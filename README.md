# Notes
Building mini ARM11 CPU by Verilog.  
The assembler for this mini CPU also will be created.  
okay. let's begin with both of them.   
What should I do first?  
ARM11 architecture.  
Basic ARM architecture including what components, for example, ALU, Register, and so on.  

The first goal is building a simple pipeline, (fetch->decode->execute)  
To do that what things are needed?  
  -> the first question.  


How to test it is working well?
